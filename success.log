************************************************************************************************************************
Recent Debugger Updates
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Major Changes:

    - The debugger now has new capabilities for scripting!  JavaScript can now be used as a mechanism to both script the
      debugger itself as well as to author debugger extensions!
        [Tell me more                  : .dml_file release_feature.dml]

      To enable JavaScript in the debugger, the JavaScript provider extension must be loaded (and can subsequently be unloaded):

        [Load the JavaScript Provider  : !load JsProvider.dll]
        [Unload the JavaScript Provider: !unload JsProvider.dll]

      Once one or more script provider extensions have been loaded, a series of dot commands are available to view available providers,
      see loaded scripts, and execute them:

        [View all available providers  : .scriptproviders]
        [View all loaded scripts       : .scriptlist]
        [Load an extension script      : .scriptload <path to script>]
        [Run an imperative script      : .scriptrun <path to script>]
        [Unload a script               : .scriptunload <path to script>]

    - [Turn banner off until changed : .settings set EngineInitialization.MinBannerVersionToDisplay = 5; .settings save]
